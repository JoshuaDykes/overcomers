                    <div class="space-y-6 text-gray-600">
                        <p>
                            In the heart of Kibera, one of Africa's largest urban slums, a dream began to unfold in the hearts of Rev. Simon and Eunice Monda in the year 2000. It started humbly, as many great dreams do, with a simple yet profound mission: to feed hungry children and share God's word with them. Every weekend, the founders of what would become the Overcomers Ministries gathered their resources and opened their hearts, ensuring that over 250 children from the most desperate circumstances could enjoy a meal and hear about God. For many, it was the only reliable meal they would have all week.
                        </p>

                        <h4 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">A deeper need…</h4>
                        <p>
                            But feeding the children was only the beginning. As Simon and Eunice spent time with these young souls, they discovered an even deeper need—education. Many of the children were not attending school, their futures hanging precariously in the balance. The founders began to dream of a school, a place where these children could learn, grow, and break free from the cycle of poverty. This dream, though ambitious, felt right. It felt necessary.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The breakthrough came in 2004 when a chief from Kibera, moved by the efforts of the founders and the plight of the children, offered them a piece of land in the Bangladesh slums of Ongata Rongai. It was a modest plot, but it represented hope and opportunity. Here, they erected temporary structures that would serve as both a school and a home for the most vulnerable children.
                        </p>

                        <h4 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">A heartbreaking moment…</h4>
                        <p>
                            However, tragedy struck when Overcomers Ministries were given a 5-day notice to vacate the land to allow for the expansion of Magadi Road. Before the notice expired, the home and school were demolished. This heartbreaking story was featured on national news, capturing the attention of many.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A pastor friend of the Rev. Simon stepped in and offered them a temporary place at Serengei, near Maasai Lodge, in Ongata Rongai. With determination, they put up classes and continued their mission to feed and educate. But their troubles were far from over. Shortly after, they were again forced to vacate by a popular, machete-wielding bishop who brought young men to demolish the place, claiming that the land belonged to him.
                        </p>

                        <h4 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">A new dawn…</h4>
                        <p>
                            After the eviction, God opened new doors for the Overcomers Ministries, when Kevin and Jackie, directors of the Overflow Ministries Group, leased space for them within Ongata Rongai, where they put up temporary structures to serve as a home, classes, and place of worship for over 200 children. Starting with early childhood classes (PP1) and going all the way to Class 8, the school became a beacon of hope for children who had known nothing but hardship. Within those simple walls, they were fed, learned to read and write, dream, and believe in a brighter future.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Kevin and Jackie have continued supporting the Overcomers Ministries in various ways, including paying utility bills, providing ICT facilities, sourcing and paying for the children's psychosocial support, and even sponsoring some children's education and personal needs, among others.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            What started as a weekend feeding program has evolved into a life-changing ministry with programs focussing on education, child protection, health and nutrition, and child development.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Today, their formidable legacy is embedded in the success stories of young men and women who joined them as hopeless children and have grown into mature, responsible people who are inspiring future generations to dream big and act boldly in the face of adversity.

                                He lived with a family at Bangladesh that broke up. Chris came to overcomers gates carrying his clothes in a polythene bag with tears in his eyes. He wasn't able to communicate in English or Swahili. Fortunately the overcomer's matron happened to understand Chris' vernacular. The first three days, Chris couldn't talk to anybody but only cry.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After one month he adjusted and started learning at OCM in nursery. He has gone through early childhood education and full primary school at OCM. After graduating from Overcomers he joined Olekasasi high school. He did his KCSE exam and joined NIBS to pursue fashion and design. He graduated from NIBS and he's aspiring to have his own fashion business which can create employment for other overcomer's children and also enable him to become stable in life. Overcomers has been a home that has moulded Chris to who he is.

The mother left Duncan with his abusive father and ran away. He went through hard times without food and schooling. One day he came to overcomers having one hundred shillings. He was wearing an oversized raged trouser in form of a short.

                                He gave teacher Eunice the one hundred shillings pleading to join overcomers in order to learn. He was too big to join baby class as he had not started schooling. Finally he joined pre unit and Tr Eunice organised the pre-school teachers to assist him catch up with the rest of the kids. He has gone through his childhood education and full primary school.
